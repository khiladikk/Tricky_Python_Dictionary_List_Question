Q5. (Create a program that fulfills the following specification.)

Program Specification

Return the "centered" average of an array of integers, which we'll say is the mean average of the values, except ignoring the largest and smallest values in the array. If there are multiple copies of the smallest value, ignore just one copy, and likewise for the largest value. Use int division to produce the final average. You may assume that the array is length 3 or more.(Take input from user)

Input

1, 2, 3, 4, 100
Output

3


Q6. (Create a program that fulfills the following specification.)

Program Specification

Return the sum of the numbers in the array, returning 0 for an empty array. Except the number 13 is very unlucky, so it does not count and numbers that come immediately after a 13 also do not count.(Take input from user)

Input

13, 1, 2, 13, 2, 1, 13
Output

3
